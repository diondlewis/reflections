When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I'm collaborating with another user or I want to share my code online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that I can keep track of when my local file acutally updates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork copies an existing repository on GitHub to Github but is not a local copy.
    A clone copies a repository from GitHub to your local computer. A branch adds additional information
    to an existing repository either on GitHub or on a local computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
